# Stop Advertising
 We own the game and The Pimps have the nerve to advertise merch and other products to us? Not on my watch!

# How it works
Uses xpath to remove the 'featuredNews', 'gameNews', and (presently commented out) 'guides' elements from the news menu, reducing it to a splash screen before the main menu.

# Usage rights
I don't care. Respect the license but otherwise do as you will.
